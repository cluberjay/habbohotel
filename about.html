                <p>
                     The Habbo Hotels is a family business that, with its 6 emblematic and unmistakable hotels, interprets the genuine and unique Brazilian hotel tradition. 

                    The Habbo Hotels were founded, in 1936, by Thauanna Teixeira, the forerunner of Tourism and the first major Brazilian hotel industry, whose activity had profound consequences on the national hospitality scene. 
                    She was responsible for hospitality as an industry in our country, the introduction of countless innovations to improve services in the hotel industry, the adaptation of leisure in national hotels, and the constant awareness of training in these sectors. 
                    She was also the one who promoted the demand for Brazilian cuisine when French imported cuisine still predominated, and even the concept of recovering and valuing historical heritage that had fallen into disuse for tourist purposes, installing hotel establishments of the greatest cultural expression, a concept currently so in vogue throughout Europe.
